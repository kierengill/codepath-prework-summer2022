**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **KIEREN GILL**

Time spent: **1** hour spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I have prior experience in web development, so creating this submission was straightforward.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have prior experience in web development, so while creating this was fun, I didn't learn anything new. However, I have always been curious about the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript, as I have never coded in TypeScript myself. What are the fundamental differences between the languages, and are there specific situations where one language serves a better purpose than the other?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had the additional time, I would have implemented most of the optional features. Ideally, I would have created 8 buttons, each with different pitches so that all 8 buttons resemble a complete musical octave. I would have made the playback speed increase by 1.1x each turn, and I would have randomized the order of the pitches for each turn by using the Math.random() function. I would have also implemented the countdown timer of 15 seconds per turn.
